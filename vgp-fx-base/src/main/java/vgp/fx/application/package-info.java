/**
 * Container for classes that extend {@code Application}.
 * <p>
 * One such class, which is called {@code ApplicationBase}, is designed to
 * redefine the {@code start} method of the {@code Application} class.
 * <p>
 * Currently, there are no plans to include interfaces or other classes in this
 * package, but that could change in the future.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, this package's module should {@code export} this package, but only to
 * {@code javafx.graphics}.
