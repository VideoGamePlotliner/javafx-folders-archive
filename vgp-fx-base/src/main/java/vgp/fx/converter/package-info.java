/**
 * Container for classes that extend {@code StringConverter}.
 * <p>
 * One such class, which is called {@code StringConverterBase}, is designed to
 * redefine the {@code toString(Object)} method of the {@code StringConverter}
 * class.
 * <p>
 * Also, this package contains concrete implementations of
 * {@code StringConverterBase}.
 * <p>
 * Currently, there are no plans to include interfaces or other classes in this
 * package, but that could change in the future.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, this package's module should not {@code export} this package to other
 * modules.
